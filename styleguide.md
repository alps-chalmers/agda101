ALPS Agda Style Guide
=====================

Just writing down some ideas for what we want to have in our style guide.

Propositions (by Erik)
----------------------

  * No special (unicode) characters

      Since different editors/keyboard configs/operating systems have
      difficulty entering different characters we should stick to the
      basic set of symbols. Since agda lets you create arbitrarily long
      combinations of basically any characters anyway we shouldn't run out
      of expressive function/operator names anyway.

  * Type signatures?

      Some standard for type signatures so we all enter them in the same way
      for ease of reading. Agda has some syntactic sugar that we should decide
      whether we use or not.

  * Source structure

      Some guidelines for how we structure our code and handle
      imports/modules etc.
